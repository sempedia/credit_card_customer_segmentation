1. Python programming fundamentals
   - Lists
   - Loops
   - Functions
2. Data Analysis Libraries
   - Pandas
   - NumPy
   - Matplotlib
   - Seaborn

PROJECT OVERVIEW
---------------
Objective: Act as a data scientist for a credit card company to segment customers into different groups for targeted marketing strategies.

Key Components:
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Data Preprocessing
5. K-means Clustering
6. Cluster Analysis and Visualization
7. Business Insights

DATASET INFORMATION
------------------
File: customer_segmentation.csv
Contents: Fictional credit card customer data including:
- Demographics (age, gender, education, etc.)
- Account behavior
- Transaction patterns
- Credit utilization

TECHNICAL WORKFLOW
-----------------
1. Data Preparation:
   - Load and examine data structure
   - Check for missing values
   - Analyze categorical and numerical variables

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Convert categorical variables to numeric
   - Handle gender using binary encoding (M=1, F=0)
   - Education levels using ordinal encoding
   - Marital status using one-hot encoding

3. Data Processing:
   - Scale numerical features using StandardScaler
   - Remove customer_ID column
   - Prepare data for clustering

4. Clustering Analysis:
   - Use elbow method to determine optimal cluster number
   - Apply K-means clustering
   - Analyze cluster characteristics
   - Visualize results

KEY INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------
1. Cluster Characteristics:
   - Strong correlation between months_on_book and age
   - Credit limit correlates with estimated income
   - Negative correlation between total_relationship_count and transaction_amount
   - Education level showed minimal impact on clustering
   - Marital status strongly influenced cluster formation

2. Business Implications:
   - Target high-income customers with low utilization for increased card usage
   - Develop specific strategies for different marital status groups
   - Consider customer contact patterns in relation to spending

TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------
1. Data Scaling:
   - Important for K-means due to distance-based calculations
   - Standardization brings variables to similar scales

2. Categorical Variable Handling:
   - Consider impact of one-hot encoding on cluster formation
   - Potential over-influence of marital status due to multiple columns

3. Model Reproducibility:
   - Use random_state in K-means for consistent results
   - Consider multiple runs for robust clustering

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
------------------
1. Feature Engineering:
   - Experiment with different encoding methods
   - Consider feature importance and selection

2. Model Optimization:
   - Test different numbers of clusters
   - Try different distance metrics
   - Address potential marital status over-weighting

3. Analysis Enhancement:
   - Deeper dive into cluster characteristics
   - More detailed customer behavior analysis
   - Additional visualization techniques

RESOURCES
---------
- DataQuest Community Forum for questions
- Project solutions available in platform
- Recording available within 24 hours
